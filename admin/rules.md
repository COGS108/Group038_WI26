## Rules and Expectations
### Communication
**Discord** is our main form of communication. We have a group chat.
- **Responding** If there is a message that needs responding to/acknowledgement, respond within about 1 day/24 hours (48 hours can be acceptable if there's an emergency). The exception to this if we have a planned meeting coming up and we ask for a ready check, then it's expected that there's an almost immediate response.
- **Respect** Stay reasonably respectful to one another. It's okay to disagree, but do talk about the issue together or bring in another person (or the entire group) to discuss the matter if needed to mediate. If you don't talk about something, there's no way we'd know what's wrong.
  
### Missing Tasks/Meetings
- **Tasks** If you can't complete a task, let us know as soon as possible (i.e. as soon as you find out) so we can reorganize task assignment or move our schedule around.
- **Meetings** If you can't make a meeting, that's okay, and it's not detrimental. However, that would mean you can't provide your input on something live. You can share your thoughts and ideas in our group chat in this event so we can discuss your ideas. We do take meeting notes, so please read them to stay up to date with the team.

### Team Structure and Decision Making
- **Team Roles** We don't plan on having established team roles, but we'll try to have everyone do a bit of everything (to the best of our ability). The only real "role" we'll have is one note taker per meeting.
- **Task Tracking** We'll use the GitHub Projects tab/Kanban on the team repository. 
- **Decision Making** If it comes to a decision, we'll have a vote to decide (more votes = win).

### Addressing Problem Members
This is our protocol on addressing non-responsive teammates/those refusing to do work:
1. First offense: check-in and see if everything is okay.
2. Second offense: what we do depends, but we'll talk with you again.
3. Clearly becoming a pattern: talk to a TA and/or the professor.
