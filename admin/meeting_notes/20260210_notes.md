### Tasks
Tasks to assign:

- Hypothesis (awaiting feedback)
- Data and datasets
- Ethics (awaiting feedback)
- Team Expectations (awaiting feedback)
- Project Timeline Proposal

### Project Info
#### Proposal Changes
- Research question
  - Look at the top 250 games instead because looking at 50-per-category is going to be a pain logistically.
    - In terms of analysis, we could look at the number of games with x tag. Keep in mind that this would not give us a distribution as one game can be singleplayer and co-op as an example.
  - Remove: achievement numbers, google trends (search interest), new player counts. We couldn't find any reliable sources that contains this data.

### Data Checkpoint
#### Dataset 1
- Dataset source: SteamCharts 
  - Link: https://steamcharts.com/
- Things to be aware of:
  - Steam tags SUCK. Singleplayer, multiplayer, and co-op tags are loosely and sometimes even falsely applied. We may have (1) to develop and algorithm to classify it ourselves or (2) find a dataset that has these classify it for us.
  - Provides month-by-month data so adjust to calculate per-year (should be easy).
  - Cache the data so we're not sending redundant network requests to SteamCharts.
  - Probably will need to cross-reference with another dataset to match app id (i.e. game identification) to get play modes (Ashley has a Steam API key if needed).
- Covers:
  - Average concurrent players per month
  - Peak players per month

#### Dataset 2
- Dataset: Steam250
  - Link: https://steam250.com/
- Things to be aware of:
  - We would base our definition of "top games" based on how Steam250 ranks their games. They detail their process here: https://steam250.com/about
- Covers:
  - Top 250 games of x year

#### Additional Datasets (if needed)
These are only supplementary IF we find ourselves short of something. Ignore unless needed.

### To-Do
| Person | Task     | 
| ----   | ----     |
| Andy   | Dataset2 (+ play mode tagging) |
| Ashley | Dataset1 |
| Dorje  | Dataset1 |
| Kiet   | Dataset2 |
| Kobe   | Ask Ashley/Dorje OR Andy/Kiet for what group/dataset you're interested in working with/whoever needs help or schedule works best with you; do weekly Sunday meetings @ 2pm work with you? |

Project timeline still works with everyone (?)

# Next Meeting: 2/15 @ 2pm
- Goal: 40-70% completion on tasks
