    "The global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, called COVID-19, has caused a global pandemic, forcing people to isolate and quarantine from each other. During the lockdown period, people spent most of their time at home and turned to digital entertainment and video games as a way to socialize and de-stress. Therefore, the gaming industry in this period witnessed a peak in gamer activity, play time, sales, and stock values.\n",

    "There are multiple research papers conducted about games' activity and price range analysis over the course of time, such as: work from Aliev, Aliyev, and Eyniyev. However, they mainly focus on the Indie games category, while treating AAA - a pricing category - as a game category. A paper from Sener, Yalcin, and Gulseven successfully showed a significant rise in Steam activies during the COVID-19 era, but did not close in on any other said parameters. Neither of the papers mentioned are hitting the main points of analyzing the top popular games from each category.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"

    "### Communication\n",
    "**Discord** is our main form of communication. We have a group chat.\n",
    "- **Responding** If there is a message that needs responding to/acknowledgement, respond within about 1 day/24 hours (48 hours can be acceptable if there's an emergency). The exception to this if we have a planned meeting coming up and we ask for a ready check, then it's expected that there's an almost immediate response.\n",
    "- **Respect** Stay reasonably respectful to one another. It's okay to disagree, but do talk about the issue together or bring in another person (or the entire group) to discuss the matter if needed to mediate. If you don't talk about something, there's no way we'd know what's wrong.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Missing Tasks/Meetings\n",
    "- **Tasks** If you can't complete a task, let us know as soon as possible (i.e. as soon as you find out) so we can reorganize task assignment or move our schedule around.\n",
    "- **Meetings** If you can't make a meeting, that's okay, and it's not detrimental. However, that would mean you can't provide your input on something live. You can share your thoughts and ideas in our group chat in this event so we can discuss your ideas. We do take meeting notes, so please read them to stay up to date with the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Structure and Decision Making\n",
    "- **Team Roles** We don't plan on having established team roles, but we'll try to have everyone do a bit of everything (to the best of our ability). The only real \"role\" we'll have is one note taker per meeting.\n",
    "- **Task Tracking** We'll use the GitHub Projects tab/Kanban on the team repository. \n",
    "- **Decision Making** If it comes to a decision, we'll have a vote to decide (more votes = win).\n",

    "### Addressing Problem Members\n",
    "This is our protocol on addressing non-responsive teammates/those refusing to do work:\n",
    "1. First offense: check-in and see if everything is okay.\n",
    "2. Second offense: what we do depends, but we'll talk with you again.\n",
    "3. Clearly becoming a pattern: talk to a TA and/or the professor."
