    "The global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, called COVID-19, has caused a global pandemic, forcing people to isolate and quarantine from each other. During the lockdown period, people spent most of their time at home and turned to digital entertainment and video games as a way to socialize and de-stress. Therefore, the gaming industry in this period witnessed a peak in gamer activity, play time, sales, and stock values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we are interested in finding which games were the most popular from each game mode (single player, multiplayer, online co-op). Seeing what game mode people are most interested in, could give the gaming industry a better understanding of their consumer's desires. At first, the group was interested in researching the top 50 games from each game mode, between the pre-COVID period (2018-2019), the COVID era (2020-2021), and the post-COVID era (2021-2023), across multiple popular platforms such as Steam, Epic Games, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, etc. **However**, not all platforms share their players' statistics to the public. So, we narrowed down our platform domain to only include Steam because it has a public database which is called \"Steam Charts\" and \"SteamDB\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple research papers conducted about video games' activity and price range analysis over the course of time, such as the paper \"Analyzing Price Dynamics, Activity of Players and Reviews of Popular Indie Games on Steam Post-COVID-19 Pandemic using SteamDB\" by Aliev, Aliyev, and Eyniyev. However, they mainly focus on the Indie games category, while treating AAA - a pricing category - as its own game category. A paper titled \"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Video Game Industry\" from Sener, Yalcin, and Gulseven successfully showed a significant rise in player activity on Steam during the COVID-19 era, but it did not include other facotrs like playtime, pricing dynamics, etc. Additionally, neither of the papers mentioned specifically analyzed the most popular games from each game mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as curious gamers and data analysts, we decided to conduct extensive research on what are the top 50 popular games from each game mode on Steam pre, during, and post the COVID-19 era.\n",

    "We believe that there will be a dramatic rise in the popularity of online co-op and multiplayer games during and after the COVID-19 eras. Our thinking is as follows: people are stuck inside and have largely lost the ability to connect with each other in person. With a siginifcant rise in \"gamer activity\" and the desire to connect, video games which provide multiplayer or online co-op will see the largest increase in popularity because of their ability to allow people to interact online."

    "1. Explain what the **ideal** dataset you would want to answer this question. (This should include: \n",
    "An ideal dataset would have variables considering the year of the game’s popularity, the name of the game, the amount of players per game, the amount of time playing the game, and the growth across the year. It would have an observation of around 50 games for each mode (e.g. single player, multiplayer player, and online co-op). This should be enough to have a workable sample size to make claims about trends during the COVID era. We’ll be collecting data on the games played during the COVID era. This data would be nameless as it would be a number representing steam players across the platform/world regions. We will be collecting the data from the steam charts stats on game play trends across the months of each year. The data would be logged into a data table to be analyzed for different patterns and charted to express the feature of the data. We would be using the JSON format to organize our data being sure to follow the TIDY and CLEAN process so that the data is readable."

    "While searching for real life data sets we found the website: “https://steamcharts.com/“. This data is free access and we will not be asking any students or other participants to participate in surveys, so considering those methods would not be applicable. This data set includes relevant variables that we would use are the name of the game, number of players, the number of hours played, and rates of game play. Another website we are considering is: “https://steamcommunity.com/dev”. This data is also free access and will not include surveys. However it does require a steam log in to access. We would consider similar important variables such as top games per year, game mode played, and the number of players and copies sold.",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project does not involve human subjects directly. We are analyzing publicly avaliable gaming statistics from Steam, which does not require consent.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We agree that by focusing solely on Steam data, we introduce platform bias. However, our research question is specifically aimed on PC gaming on Steam.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Our dataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII). We are using aggregate player statistics and game mode data only.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> We are not collecting data on protected groups such as gender or race, as our analysis focuses on gaming trends at the aggregate game mode rather than individual player demographics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> The data we are using is publicly available from Steam Charts and SteamDB. We are not collecting any new data or storing sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> Not applicable, as we are not collecting or storing any personal information from indivisuals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> Since we are using publicly available data and not collecting new data, data retention is not our concern. Any data we download for analysis will be retained only for the duration of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> We acknowledge that other gaming platforms exist (e.g., Nintendo, Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox) and provide different gaming experiences. However, our research question is intentionally narrowed to PC gaming on Steam due to data availability and accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> There could be potential bias in our dataset if certain games have wealthy backers who promote them more heavily, which could inflate their popularity metrics. We are aware of this possibility when interpreting our results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We are committed to representing our data honestly and will strive to create visualization and statistics that accurately reflect the underlying trends without misleading interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> Privacy is not a conter for our analysis since we are not using any data with PII. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We are committed to documenting our analysis process thoroughly to ensure reproducibility. This includes maintaining clear records of our data sources, processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We are considering PC players as a general population. Since our analysis focuses on game mode trends rather than player demographics, bias and discrimination concerns are not relevant to our research.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> Not applicable for the same reason as D.1.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We are not creating a predictive model or optimizing for specific metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Not applicable, as we are not buliding a predictive model or making automated decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> While we are not buliding a model, we will clearly communicate the limitation of our analysis, including our focus on Steam data only and potential biases in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Not applicable. We are not deploying a model. This is a research project analyzing game mode trends.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> Not applicable as our analysis is unlikely to cause harm and we are not deploying a system that impacts indivisuals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> Not applicable for the Same reason as E.1\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We are using publicly available data for academic research purposes. The risk of unintended use is unlikely happening since we are not creating a deployed system or collecting sensitive data.\n"

The exception to this if we have a planned meeting coming up and we ask for a ready check, then it's expected that there's an almost immediate response.\n",

    "- **Meetings** If you can't make a meeting, that's okay, and it's not detrimental. However, that would mean you can't provide your input on something live. You can share your thoughts and ideas in our group chat in this event so we can discuss your ideas. We do take meeting notes, so please read them to stay up to date with the team.\n",
