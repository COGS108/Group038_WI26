    "The global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, called COVID-19, has caused a global pandemic, forcing people to isolate and quarantine from each other. During the lockdown period, people spent most of their time at home and turned to digital entertainment and video games as a way to socialize and de-stress. Therefore, the gaming industry in this period witnessed a peak in gamer activity, play time, sales, and stock values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we are interested in finding which games were the most popular from each game mode (single player, multiplayer, online co-op). Seeing what game mode people are most interested in, could give the gaming industry a better understanding of their consumer's desires. At first, the group was interested in researching the top 50 games from each game mode, between the pre-COVID period (2018-2019), the COVID era (2020-2021), and the post-COVID era (2021-2023), across multiple popular platforms such as Steam, Epic Games, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, etc. **However**, not all platforms share their players' statistics to the public. So, we narrowed down our platform domain to only include Steam because it has a public database which is called \"Steam Charts\" and \"SteamDB\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple research papers conducted about video games' activity and price range analysis over the course of time, such as:\n",
    "- Aliev et al. (2025): These researchers investigated how the pandemic affected the prices and player reviews of mostly Indie games on Steam. By analyzing SteamDB data, they found that player reviews and activity levels are highly correlated. This study confirmed that SteamDB is a reliable tool for our project, but their work mostly focused on Indie games category while treating AAA - a pricing category - as its own game category, but also, we want to look at the top 50 games overall from each game mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Şener et al. (2021): This paper successfully investigated the broader economic impact of COVID-19 on the gaming industry and showed a significant rise in player activity on Steam during 2020. Their findings gave us a \"baseline\" of when player activity started to increase, but it did not include other factors like playtime, pricing dynamics, game modes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Toledo (2021): Toledo used consumer **surveys** to study how gaming habits changed during lockdown. The survey showed that games became a bridge to \"online social life\" during quarantine period. This findings is why we emphasize on comparing Online Co-op and Multiplayer modes against Single Player games, as we wanted to see if that online social trend lasted after the pandemic ends. This is the harder data to categorize due to Steam tags are very misleading by mixing Singleplayers and Multiplayers altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as curious gamers and data analysts, we decided to conduct extensive research on what are the top 50 popular games from each game mode on Steam pre, during, and post the COVID-19 era.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    "  [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project does not involve human subjects directly. We are analyzing publicly avaliable gaming statistics from Steam, which does not require consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We agree that by focusing solely on Steam data, we introduce platform bias. However, our research question is specifically aimed on PC gaming on Steam.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Our dataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII). We are using aggregate player statistics and game mode data only.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> We are not collecting data on protected groups such as gender or race, as our analysis focuses on gaming trends at the aggregate game mode rather than individual player demographics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "  [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> The data we are using is publicly available from Steam Charts and SteamDB. We are not collecting any new data or storing sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> Not applicable, as we are not collecting or storing any personal information from indivisuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> Since we are using publicly available data and not collecting new data, data retention is not our concern. Any data we download for analysis will be retained only for the duration of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    "  [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> We acknowledge that other gaming platforms exist (e.g., Nintendo, Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox, Mobile) which provide different gaming experiences. Our dataset is limited to Steam users, who may not be representative of the global gaming population (e.g., mobile gamers or console game players). However, our research question is intentionally narrowed to PC gaming on Steam due to data availability and accessibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> There could be potential bias in our dataset if certain games have wealthy backers who promote them more heavily, which could inflate their popularity metrics. We are aware of this possibility when interpreting our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We are committed to representing our data honestly and will strive to create visualization and statistics that accurately reflect the underlying trends without misleading interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> Privacy is not a conter for our analysis since we are not using any data with PII. \n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We are committed to documenting our analysis process thoroughly to ensure reproducibility. This includes maintaining clear records of our data sources, processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "  [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We are considering PC players as a general population. Since our analysis focuses on game mode trends rather than player demographics, bias and discrimination concerns are not relevant to our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> Not applicable for the same reason as D.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We are not creating a predictive model or optimizing for specific metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Not applicable, as we are not buliding a predictive model or making automated decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> While we are not buliding a model, we will clearly communicate the limitation of our analysis, including our focus on Steam data only and potential biases in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    "  [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Not applicable. We are not deploying a model. This is a research project analyzing game mode trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> Not applicable as our analysis is unlikely to cause harm and we are not deploying a system that impacts indivisuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> Not applicable for the Same reason as E.1\n",
    "\n",
    "  [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We are using data for research, but game developers might usage our results. For example, if they see old games were popular, they might just copy them instead of making new, creative games. This could lead to too many similar games and less variety for players."
