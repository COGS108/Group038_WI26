    "We belive there will be a dramatic rise in the popularity of online co-op and multiplayer games during the COVID era, with some of that increase continuing after COVID. Our thinking is as follows: people were stuck inside and had largely lost the ability to connect with each other in person, so games that allowed online interaction became more appealing. In this study, popularity will be measured using average concurrent player count and peak player count, and we will examine these patterns within the top 250 Steam games across the pre-COVID period (2018-2019), COVID period (2020-2021), and post-COVID period (2022-2023). We also expect that, within the top 250, the number of games tagged as multiplayer or online co-op will increase during COVID compared with pre-COVID, though we recognize that tags are not mutually exclusive and a game may appear in more than one mode.

Both metrics are counts of players (not percentages), and both are useful: average concurrency reflects sustained engagement, while peak concurrency reflects major surges and maximum demand."

    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
    "5. Feel free to add more cells here if that's helpful for you\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the most relevant variables are: game identifier (name and/or appid), date (month/year), average concurrent players, and peak concurrent players. We will later aggregate monthly values into three study periods: pre-COVID (2018–2019), COVID (2020–2021), and post-COVID (2022–2023). This allows direct period-to-period comparisons for each game and for groups of games by mode tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength of this dataset is that it provides consistent, public, longitudinal Steam activity data at scale. The main shortcomings are that it is Steam-only (not representative of console ecosystems), may underrepresent edge cases where historical coverage is incomplete for certain titles, and does not directly provide causal explanations for changes in player activity. Also, top-game selection introduces survivorship/popularity bias relative to the full Steam catalog."
