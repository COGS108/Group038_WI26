    "The global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, called COVID-19, has caused a global pandemic, forcing people to isolate and quarantine from each other. During the lockdown period, people spent most of their time at home and turned to digital entertainment and video games as a way to socialize and de-stress. Therefore, the gaming industry in this period witnessed a peak in gamer activity, play time, sales, and stock values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we are interested in finding which games were the most popular from each game mode (single player, multiplayer, online co-op). Seeing what game mode people are most interested in, could give the gaming industry a better understanding of their consumer's desires. At first, the group was interested in researching the top 50 games from each game mode, between the pre-COVID period (2018-2019), the COVID era (2020-2021), and the post-COVID era (2021-2023), across multiple popular platforms such as Steam, Epic Games, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, etc. **However**, not all platforms share their players' statistics to the public. So, we narrowed down our platform domain to only include Steam because it has a public database which is called \"Steam Charts\" and \"SteamDB\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple research papers conducted about video games' activity and price range analysis over the course of time, such as:\n",
    "- Aliev et al. (2025): These researchers investigated how the pandemic affected the prices and player reviews of mostly Indie games on Steam. By analyzing SteamDB data, they found that player reviews and activity levels are highly correlated. This study confirmed that SteamDB is a reliable tool for our project, but their work mostly focused on Indie games category while treating AAA - a pricing category - as its own game category, but also, we want to look at the top 50 games overall from each game mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Şener et al. (2021): This paper successfully investigated the broader economic impact of COVID-19 on the gaming industry and showed a significant rise in player activity on Steam during 2020. Their findings gave us a \"baseline\" of when player activity started to increase, but it did not include other factors like playtime, pricing dynamics, game modes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Toledo (2021): Toledo used consumer **surveys** to study how gaming habits changed during lockdown. The survey showed that games became a bridge to \"online social life\" during quarantine period. This findings is why we emphasize on comparing Online Co-op and Multiplayer modes against Single Player games, as we wanted to see if that online social trend lasted after the pandemic ends. This is the harder data to categorize due to Steam tags are very misleading by mixing Singleplayers and Multiplayers altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as curious gamers and data analysts, we decided to conduct extensive research on what are the top 50 popular games from each game mode on Steam pre, during, and post the COVID-19 era.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
