    "The global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, called COVID-19, has caused a global pandemic, forcing people to isolate and quarantine from each other. During the lockdown period, people spent most of their time at home and turned to digital entertainment and video games as a way to socialize and de-stress. Therefore, the gaming industry in this period witnessed a peak in gamer activity, play time, sales, and stock values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we are interested in finding which games were the most popular from each game mode (single player, multiplayer, online co-op). Seeing what game mode people are most interested in, could give the gaming industry a better understanding of their consumer's desires. At first, the group was interested in researching the top 50 games from each game mode, between the pre-COVID period (2018-2019), the COVID era (2020-2021), and the post-COVID era (2021-2023), across multiple popular platforms such as Steam, Epic Games, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, etc. **However**, not all platforms share their players' statistics to the public. So, we narrowed down our platform domain to only include Steam because it has a public database which is called \"Steam Charts\" and \"SteamDB\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple research papers conducted about video games' activity and price range analysis over the course of time, such as:\n",
    "- Aliev et al. (2025): These researchers investigated how the pandemic affected the prices and player reviews of mostly Indie games on Steam. By analyzing SteamDB data, they found that player reviews and activity levels are highly correlated. This study confirmed that SteamDB is a reliable tool for our project, but their work mostly focused on Indie games category while treating AAA - a pricing category - as its own game category, but also, we want to look at the top 50 games overall from each game mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Şener et al. (2021): This paper successfully investigated the broader economic impact of COVID-19 on the gaming industry and showed a significant rise in player activity on Steam during 2020. Their findings gave us a \"baseline\" of when player activity started to increase, but it did not include other factors like playtime, pricing dynamics, game modes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Toledo (2021): Toledo used consumer **surveys** to study how gaming habits changed during lockdown. The survey showed that games became a bridge to \"online social life\" during quarantine period. This findings is why we emphasize on comparing Online Co-op and Multiplayer modes against Single Player games, as we wanted to see if that online social trend lasted after the pandemic ends. This is the harder data to categorize due to Steam tags are very misleading by mixing Singleplayers and Multiplayers altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as curious gamers and data analysts, we decided to conduct extensive research on what are the top 50 popular games from each game mode on Steam pre, during, and post the COVID-19 era.\n",

    "We believe there will be a dramatic rise in the popularity of online co-op and multiplayer games during the COVID era, with some of that increase continuing after COVID. Our thinking is as follows: people were stuck inside and had largely lost the ability to connect with each other in person, so games that allowed online interaction became more appealing. In this study, popularity will be measured using average concurrent player count and peak player count, and we will examine these patterns within the top 250 Steam games across the pre-COVID period (2018-2019), COVID period (2020-2021), and post-COVID period (2022-2023). We also expect that, within the top 250, the number of games tagged as multiplayer or online co-op will increase during COVID compared with pre-COVID, though we recognize that tags are not mutually exclusive and a game may appear in more than one mode.

In practical terms, average concurrent players captures the typical number of people actively playing a game at the same time during a month, while peak concurrent players captures the maximum simultaneous activity reached during that month. Both metrics are counts of players (not percentages), and both are useful: average concurrency reflects sustained engagement, while peak concurrency reflects major surges and maximum demand.\n",

    "This dataset was provided by Martin Bustos on Kaggle. Bustos created the dataset using Steam's API and Steam Spy. It provides meta information of over 122,000 games on Steam. It has 39 variables. However, we are only interested in three key variables while being able to ignore the rest as they are not important to our research question:\n",
    "1. AppID is a integer value that uniquely identifies each and every game on Steam.\n",
    "2. Name is a string that belongs to the name of the game.\n",
    "3. Categories should be an array of strings. Each string corresponds to a characterization of the game such as \"singleplayer\" or \"PvP.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll discover, reading the CSV proved to be a little troublesome with column mismatch. Since we're only concerned with the Categories of each game this dataset provides, we can safely disregard the other columns. There were other datasets we experimented with that didn't fully account for all of the games we've gathered.\n",

    "### SteamCharts Player Data Collection\n",
    "For this project, the most relevant variables are: game identifier (name and appid), date (month and year), average concurrent players, and peak concurrent players. \n",
    "- A game name (a string) may not be unique against the entire Steam catalog, so there exists a Steam appid that uniquely identifies each game. This is a number, and it is expected every game has one. \n",
    "- Dates are going to have some format similar to `YYYY-MM` such that we can parse it to aggregate the monthly player data by the defined study periods.\n",
    "- Average and peak concurrent players are numeric values that we expect to be greater than or equal to zero. Since we are looking at the top 250 Steam games, it's expected this value is certainly greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may later aggregate monthly values into three study periods: pre-COVID (2018–2019), COVID (2020–2021), and post-COVID (2022–2023). This allows direct period-to-period comparisons for each game and for groups of games by mode tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength of this dataset is that it provides consistent and public Steam activity data at scale. SteamCharts obtains data directly from Steam's Web API. The main shortcomings are that it is Steam-only therefore not representative of console ecosystems like Nintendo, Sony, and Xbox's. This may lead to underrepresention and edge cases where historical coverage is incomplete for certain titles and does not directly provide causal explanations for changes in player activity. It is also important to note Steam does not record data for players who decide to play offline i.e. disconnected from the internet therefore disconnected from Steam's servers. As such, the data does not account for these cases even if players are playing through Steam. Lastly, the top-game selection introduces survivorship/popularity bias relative to the full Steam catalog, leaving out games that may see interesting growth or variability in their player populations despite not being in the top 250."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    "  [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project does not involve human subjects directly. We are analyzing publicly avaliable gaming statistics from Steam, which does not require consent.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We agree that by focusing solely on Steam data, we introduce platform bias. However, our research question is specifically aimed on PC gaming on Steam.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Our dataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII). We are using aggregate player statistics and game mode data only.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> We are not collecting data on protected groups such as gender or race, as our analysis focuses on gaming trends at the aggregate game mode rather than individual player demographics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> The data we are using is publicly available from Steam Charts and SteamDB. We are not collecting any new data or storing sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> Not applicable, as we are not collecting or storing any personal information from indivisuals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> Since we are using publicly available data and not collecting new data, data retention is not our concern. Any data we download for analysis will be retained only for the duration of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> We acknowledge that other gaming platforms exist (e.g., Nintendo, Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox, Mobile) which provide different gaming experiences. Our dataset is limited to Steam users, who may not be representative of the global gaming population (e.g., mobile gamers or console game players). However, our research question is intentionally narrowed to PC gaming on Steam due to data availability and accessibility. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> There could be potential bias in our dataset if certain games have wealthy backers who promote them more heavily, which could inflate their popularity metrics. We are aware of this possibility when interpreting our results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We are committed to representing our data honestly and will strive to create visualization and statistics that accurately reflect the underlying trends without misleading interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> Privacy is not a conter for our analysis since we are not using any data with PII. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We are committed to documenting our analysis process thoroughly to ensure reproducibility. This includes maintaining clear records of our data sources, processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We are considering PC players as a general population. Since our analysis focuses on game mode trends rather than player demographics, bias and discrimination concerns are not relevant to our research.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> Not applicable for the same reason as D.1.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We are not creating a predictive model or optimizing for specific metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Not applicable, as we are not buliding a predictive model or making automated decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> While we are not buliding a model, we will clearly communicate the limitation of our analysis, including our focus on Steam data only and potential biases in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Not applicable. We are not deploying a model. This is a research project analyzing game mode trends.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> Not applicable as our analysis is unlikely to cause harm and we are not deploying a system that impacts indivisuals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> Not applicable for the Same reason as E.1\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We are using data for research, but game developers might usage our results. For example, if they see old games were popular, they might just copy them instead of making new, creative games. This could lead to too many similar games and less variety for players."

    "### Communication\n",
    "**Discord** is our main form of communication. We have a group chat.\n",
    "- **Responding** If there is a message that needs responding to/acknowledgement, respond within about 1 day/24 hours (48 hours can be acceptable if there's an emergency). The exception to this if we have a planned meeting coming up and we ask for a ready check, then it's expected that there's an almost immediate response.\n",
    "- **Respect** Stay reasonably respectful to one another. It's okay to disagree, but do talk about the issue together or bring in another person (or the entire group) to discuss the matter if needed to mediate. If you don't talk about something, there's no way we'd know what's wrong.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Missing Tasks/Meetings\n",
    "- **Tasks** If you can't complete a task, let us know as soon as possible (i.e. as soon as you find out) so we can reorganize task assignment or move our schedule around.\n",
    "- **Meetings** If you can't make a meeting, that's okay, and it's not detrimental. However, that would mean you can't provide your input on something live. You can share your thoughts and ideas in our group chat in this event so we can discuss your ideas. We do take meeting notes, so please read them to stay up to date with the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Structure and Decision Making\n",
    "- **Team Roles** We don't plan on having established team roles, but we'll try to have everyone do a bit of everything (to the best of our ability). The only real \"role\" we'll have is one note taker per meeting.\n",
    "- **Task Tracking** We'll use the GitHub Projects tab/Kanban on the team repository. \n",
    "- **Decision Making** If it comes to a decision, we'll have a vote to decide (more votes = win).\n",

    "### Addressing Problem Members\n",
    "This is our protocol on addressing non-responsive teammates/those refusing to do work:\n",
    "1. First offense: check-in and see if everything is okay.\n",
    "2. Second offense: what we do depends, but we'll talk with you again.\n",
    "3. Clearly becoming a pattern: talk to a TA and/or the professor."
